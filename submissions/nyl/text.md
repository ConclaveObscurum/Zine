Traversal

This series of multispectral images capture the echoes left behind by beings capable of phasing in and out of existence.  When traversing across dimensions, the length of their presence has been recorded to last anywhere between a 20th of a second, to a full minute. The reason for their crossing through our spectrum remains a mystery.
