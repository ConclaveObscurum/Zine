Forgotten Spaces
================

Old haunts, old friends, old lives.  
  
As time moves ever forward, the communities we orbit slowly drift apart. They weather with age; cracking and shifting with every step in their halls.  
  
Our digital residences are ephemeral, a cloud of bits instantaneously beamed to our screens, making them dance with light. We revel in the cacophony of colors and sounds, conjuring new waves of enjoyment with mystical tools and cryptic humor to fight off the gnawing nihilism that creeps in at the door.  
  
Yet every dance has its last step, each battery depletes. It may cease with a whisper or rend an explosive, irreparable wound, and then it is gone. The flash of lights goes dark, all ports close, and no one will ever return.  
  
I sing this elegy for every dead world I have set rested upon, these transient places that I have called my home, that have all made me feel more free to be myself than any other place in reality.  

The mere act of connection, however, changes us irrevocably. A cascade of information emanating from a single point, a single link, can wash over and bathe you anew, transformed, transcended.  
  
Your home is in each forgotten space and will live alongside you. Seek the new and the strange, immerse yourself in unknown variables, and the unfathomable depths will beckon you unlike any other realm trapped in these four dimensions.

New horizons, new evolutions, new possibilities await.
