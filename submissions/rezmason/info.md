The emblems of genji-mon are an ancient symbol for relationships between packets of incense.
They were borrowed as a symbol for relationships between characters in the world's oldest novel.
They were borrowed again as a symbol for relationships between generations of families.
They were borrowed again as a symbol for relationships between elements of a mathematical set.

Genji-mon link scents to romantic fiction, to family lineages, to mathematicians.
Furthermore, there is a relationship underlying the shapes of the different symbols, which I continue to explore.
