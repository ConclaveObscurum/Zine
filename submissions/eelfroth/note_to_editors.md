- no need to print every image

- "circles" should be printed alongside the source code
downscale with cubic (or similar) interpolation

- "crystals" is pixel art. upscale by integer factor without interpolation

- "rounding error" can be scaled however. upscaling with interpolation looks alright

- every image can be rotated in 90Â° steps to fit the page/slot (they don't really have a preferred orientation)
