                              X: MONEY AND MAKING; MAKING AND MONEY

                      for things to get made, people've got to get paid. not
                      because money is inherently good, but because living most
                      likely costs money. (for food and electricity and housing)

                      so...
                      you can get paid to make the thing you are making
                      you can get paid from the thing you are making
                      you can get paid from another thing, while making the thing you are making
                      you can not get paid and make the thing you are making

                      these all result in a thing being made, though the thing
                      being made is sculpted by which option, or combination of
                      options, that fuel the making.

                      some of the options lead to a very nice thing, true to
                      the idea that sprouted in your mind. other options can lead to a
                      very nice thing, but chances are they'll compromise the
                      idea and it'll just be an okay thing.

                      regardless you will have made a thing, and hopefully that
                      thing has made you, and will make other people, happy.
